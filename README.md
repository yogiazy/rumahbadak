Rumahbadak.id is a project that I have developed, which is a web-based attendance system using fingerprint and CCTV camera technology integrated with ESP32 Cam, and cloud computing. This system aims to provide an efficient and secure way of tracking attendance for organizations, schools, and businesses.

With this system, users can easily register their fingerprint and/or photo through the integrated fingerprint and CCTV camera system. The data captured by the cameras is then processed and stored securely in the cloud, providing real-time attendance tracking and monitoring.

The ESP32 Cam module is used to capture and process the data from the cameras, while the cloud computing system provides the storage and processing power required to handle large amounts of attendance data.

One of the key features of this system is its flexibility and ease of use. The system can be easily customized to fit the specific needs of each organization, including the ability to generate attendance reports and send automated notifications to users.

Overall, Rumahbadak.id is a reliable and efficient attendance system that leverages the latest technology to provide an innovative solution for attendance tracking and management.
