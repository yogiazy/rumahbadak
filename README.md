Rumahbadak.id is a project that I have developed, which is a web-based attendance system using fingerprint and CCTV camera technology integrated with ESP32 Cam, and cloud computing. This system aims to provide an efficient and secure way of tracking attendance for organizations, schools, and businesses.
